      # This tells the UI at build time (if it reads REACT_APP_API_URL) to use the api service
      - REACT_APP_API_URL=http://api:8000

# Note:
# - The UI will reach the API at http://api:8000 inside Docker network.
# - Mapping the ports to 127.0.0.1 ensures the services are only reachable from the host's localhost.
# - If your React app consumes a different env var name, update the environment key above or bake the URL into the build.
